**Programmers:** *Christian Skydt & Jakob Wulff*


## Project Description
The requirements for this assignment, was to build a program capable of "crawling & scraping" the contents of a website and saving the content from each individual site into locally stored .md files without the use of any third party modules. The advice was to choose a small website and also get some sort of limit on how many links should be followed.
