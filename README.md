This repository contains the source code for my exam project in the python elective at KEA's computer science course. See install instructions and project description below

## Description
### 1. Implement a new feature in the app (not been taught by me in during class) 
For this I decided to implement several things. Firstly a ListView using an ArrayAdapter to present the names of my objects. Secondly an AlertDialog to make the user confirm their selection and thirdly, I built an option to save and load my objects using Google's Gson library, to store my own objects as Json strings in Shared Preferences.

### 2. Send a mail to the teacher being rated with the results
This one was tricky. What I wanted to achieve was the app sending an email automatically to a teacher after they were rated. So far I have been unsuccessfull in building something that doesn't open the Gmail App and inserts the required values. The code is there but commented out.

### 3. Validate input from user
Since I'm only taking RatingBar and ListView inputs in this app (floats & Strings), there wasn't a lot of validation required. I basicaly just cast the view as a button and extract the text or get the numeric value from the RatingBars.

### 4. Clean architecture 
Achived by splitting up views, DAO's & models into seperate packages and trying to follow basic GRASP principles.
