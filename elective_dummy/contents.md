# Exam, Python elective Spring 2019


## Exam flow
The exam is an oral exam where part of it is based on your handed in project. The exam is evaluated according to the 7 step scale.  
The 3 last weeks of this elective you will be given 4 projects from which you should choose 1 as your exam project.  
The project should be published at Github and a link to the repository should be handed in on Wiseflow. If your repository is private you should grant me (clbokea - clbo@kea.dk) access to your private repository.  
The project should be in a state where it is possible to clone the project and run it on the teacher and sensor computers. There should be a readme file in the repository describing the project and how to install and run it.  
If you fail to hand in the project, you can not attend the exam.  
Exam time: Total 30 min.  

* 2-3 min. presentation and demo of your project (not the code)

* Be sure to demonstrate that you solved the tasks stated in the requirements.

* 7-8 min. questions about your project (here we look at your code)

* 10-12 min. general questions based on the curriculum

* 5 min. grading and feedback

* 5 minutes buffer
You will be graded on the:  

* overall state of the handed in project.

* presentation of the project.

* quality of the code and documentation.

* ability to answer questions connected to the project.

* level of understanding of the general curriculum.
During the exam the you will be asked to do "live coding".  
The projects from where the you should choose 1 exam project are:  

## Specific projects
You can read about the specific project by following the links in the  
menu above

## General for all projects

* The project should be finished, meaning: donÂ´t hand in and show up at the exam with something half done.

* Your code will be evaluated in terms of readability

* Your project will be evaluated in relation to the extent to which it is perceived as a finished product.

* The code should be documented and you should be able to explain why you documented your code in the way you did.

* The code should be tested and you should at the exam be abel to talk about your tests and demonstrate them.
All projects have been solved by someone else in the world before you, so it would be possible to pip install a module that more or less solves the task. It is not a good idea to use this approach. You should solve the task from scratch and use the python techniques you learned during this semester. On the other hand it is fine to use the build in modules that we used during this semester, and it can also make sense in some cases to use 3rd party modules.

Black Jack Rules  
Further requirements

## The game should be terminal based (text based), so no gui should be implemented.

* The game should be a single player game. One player against the computer.

* The player should be able to choose if he or she wants to be a player or a dealer.

* A bet functionality should be implemented.

* If you like you can see some more pictures of the game on this
site  

# An application of your own choice.

You can create whatever you want, as long as you can show me (Claus) a precise requirements specification before you start, and get it approved.  
It is important, that you at the exam precisely demonstrate the fulfilments of these requirements.  
When your requirements have been approved, they can not be changed.  

# Crawl a web site and save the content in markdown

this website  
crawl it and "scrape" it.
The content of the website should be saved in markdown formatted files on your computer.  
It can be a good idea to choose a relatively small website.  
It can also be a good idea to have some sort of limit on which links you want to follow.  
What you choose to retrieve from the crawled site is up to you. But you should describe why you choose to do like you did.  

## An Example
A html page looking like this:  
reThe links to follow (crawl) would in this case be "about.html" and "contact.html"  

# Help the police find the criminals

SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv  
file you should create a console application.

* In the application you should be able to search for crimes based on the data in the different columns in the dataset.

* The application should be able to take a gps point (lon-lat) and return a list of crimes made within a radius of 5 km.

* The data output should be readable (for normal users).

* The application should furthermore be able to add new records to the dataset. (this includes writing to the csv file.)

* The application should be able to export the whole dataset into json and html formats, and should be able to export search results in json and and html formats as well.
